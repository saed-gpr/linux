# Basic Linux knowledge 


### Introduction:
This repository contains a collection of resources, commands, and tips for learning fundamental and practical Linux concepts. The goal is to help new users familiarize themselves with the Linux environment, basic commands, and how to work with Linux-based operating systems.

Imagine you've installed Ubuntu or another Linux distribution (if you encounter any issues during the installation process, feel free to ask me to create a tutorial video), and now you want to start using it but don't know where to begin.
If that's the case, I suggest reading this repository to improve your Linux skills!
